# NYTArticleSearch
Basic example of using the New York Times Article API (http://developer.nytimes.com/page) for retrieving articles based on simple search parameters. (Made with HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery)

Take a look at the HTML file and determine where the actual fields for typing in the parameters to the search
are located. Also, change the default number of articles returned by the search to 10.

Also, dig around in the javascript file, and modify the years it searches to ten years around your birth year.

Make the changes, commit them and make a pull request.
